# Work Day Scheduler

A simple scheduler for your current work day to organize your day's events and tasks.

## Getting Started

Simply go to https://egarcia1868.github.io/Work_Day_Scheduler/ at the beginning of your work day, enter a task for each hour and click the floppy disk icon and the assignment will be saved to that hour until you delete it.

### Screenshot

This is how the app appears between 2:00pm and 2:59pm.  You can see the hours past appear grey, the current hour appears red, and the future hours appear green.  You can also see that an entered task shows up in a more noticable, black font.
